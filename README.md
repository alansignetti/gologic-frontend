# GoLogic Frontend - Booking Platform Challenge

This repository contains the frontend code for a Booking Platform challenge, built using Angular with Bootstrap and SweetAlert. The backend utilizes Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data storage.

## Technologies:

**Frontend:**
- Angular: Used for building the single-page application.
- Bootstrap: Employed for layout and styling.
- SweetAlert: Incorporated for user interaction with alerts and confirmations.

**Backend (Separate Repository, Not Included Here):**
- Node.js: Utilized for server-side logic and API development.
- Express: Framework for creating the backend API.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing booking information (Backend Repository Required).

## Deployment:

**Frontend:** Deployed on GitHub Pages ([https://alansignetti.github.io/gologic-frontend/]).
**Backend:** Deployed on Vercel ([https://github.com/alansignetti/gologic-backend]),[Repo](https://github.com/alansignetti/gologic-backend)
**Database:** Hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

## Challenge Description:

This challenge involved building a Booking Platform where users can:
- View a list of available rooms.
- Click on a room to see details like title, images, price, description, address, and capacity.
- Book a room by specifying their email address, desired dates, and number of guests.
- Validation to prevent booking a room on unavailable dates or exceeding the room's capacity.

## Experience with Technologies:

- I have used Node.js with Express for backend development previously, including a freelance project at [Atelier Sushi](https://sushiatelier.co.uk/).
- My experience in Frontend with Angular, React, Typescript, Bootstrap is around 3 years.

## Notes:

- The backend code for this project resides in a separate repository due to its complexity and modularity. You can find it at [Link to Backend Repository (https://github.com/alansignetti/gologic-backend)].
- This repository only contains the frontend code for the booking platform.
